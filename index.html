               It was a pleasure to work with Andrew on the DAF Training Course rebuild. I was impressed with Andrew’s focus on the Interactive Student Handbook and supplemental eLearning modules. He remained committed to ensuring the highest quality outcome for the project.

               The updated DAF Training Course now serves as a valuable resource for approximately 3,000 training managers worldwide. Early indications suggest the course has become more inclusive, ensuring a wider range of perspectives are considered. This version shows signs of actively incorporating the perspectives of Air Force Reserve, Guard, and Space Force personnel. Andrew's contributions were a valuable part of this critical update.

               Andrew single-handedly revolutionized the Department of the Air Force Training Course! As the sole author of the groundbreaking Interactive Student Handbook and the developer of supplemental eLearning modules, Andrew has fundamentally improved how we prepare Airmen to become effective trainers. Prior to Andrew's efforts, students lacked readily available reference materials after class. Now, thanks to his innovative Interactive Student Handbook, our Airmen have a comprehensive resource at their fingertips, fostering deeper understanding and retention of critical concepts. This is a game-changer! Furthermore, the eLearning modules developed by Andrew are seamlessly integrated with the course, elevating learner engagement and ensuring alignment with the latest operational readiness standards across the Education and Training career field. His dedication to modernizing this vital training program is truly commendable. Andrew's commitment to excellence and his passion for empowering Airmen are evident in the quality and impact of his work. He has not only enhanced the learning experience but has also directly contributed to the readiness and effectiveness of our training force!
