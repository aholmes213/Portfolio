            <p>I'm Andrew — a veteran instructional designer, content strategist, and USAF leader with over two decades of experience driving transformation in workforce development. Across 22 years of service, 16 focused within the Department of the Air Force, I’ve built a reputation for blending precision, creativity, and systems thinking to elevate training programs with measurable results.
                <br><br>
                Armed with a Master’s in Learning Design and a Bachelor’s in Advanced Technological Education, I’ve led cross-functional teams, rebuilt broken programs to meet rigorous USAF compliance standards, and architected scalable systems that strengthen personnel readiness. My leadership on the DAFTC rebuild directly shaped standardized training now adopted across the DAF.
                <br><br>
                I specialize in crafting immersive and accessible eLearning experiences using tools like Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, iSpring, and H5P. I go beyond template limitations by coding custom modules in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — tailoring solutions to meet learner needs at every level. My approach integrates scenario-based learning, mobile-first design, gamified techniques, and pedagogically sound content optimized for engagement and retention.
                <br><br>
                As a Bronze-Certified Kirkpatrick practitioner, I align every project with tangible outcomes — measuring performance, behavior change, and mission readiness. My work consistently reduces costs, accelerates onboarding, and delivers actionable insights through data-driven evaluation frameworks.
                <br><br>
                Beyond the design table, I mentor junior training managers and lead instructional design teams, fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. I’ve developed eLearning for diverse departments including HR, compliance, and leadership, and proactively collaborate across units to ensure accessibility and strategic alignment.
                <br><br>
                In every project, I’m guided by one goal: to push the boundaries of content design and deliver learning experiences that create impact — not just instruction.
                <br><br>
